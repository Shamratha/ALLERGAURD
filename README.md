# ALLERGAURD
PROBLEM STATEMENT

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, individuals with allergies face significant challenges in identifying allergens in food and their environment. Food labels are often hard to read, and environmental allergens like pollen and pollution are difficult to track. Managing multiple allergies requires constant attention, making it easy for individuals to miss potential risks.
AllerGuard bridges this gap by offering a mobile app that uses image recognition, natural language processing, and real-time data to provide personalized, real-time allergy management tools, helping users avoid food and environmental allergens and stay safe.

OUTPUT:
Due to some technical and logical error, the required output couldn't be generated
The end product was to create an app that helps the local with their allergy issues guiding them through what foods they need to consume and what are the medical precautions they need to take incase a particular allergy occurs. Along with this the plan was to incorporate the app in helping people with their environmantal allergies such as pollen by mentioning the pollen level in their given location by integrating it with AI.
