In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, individuals with allergies face significant challenges in identifying allergens in food and their environment. Food labels are often hard to read, and environmental allergens like pollen and pollution are difficult to track. Managing multiple allergies requires constant attention, making it easy for individuals to miss potential risks.
AllerGuard bridges this gap by offering a mobile app that uses image recognition, natural language processing, and real-time data to provide personalized, real-time allergy management tools, helping users avoid food and environmental allergens and stay safe.
